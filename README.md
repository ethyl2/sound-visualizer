# ðŸŽµ Sound Visualizer Using p5.js ðŸŽµ

I started this project while watching Lambda School's 'mini bootcamp' : https://youtu.be/o1kGyZJFRiE

and expanded on it, adding the ability to click on multiple circles, displaying random colors and using multiple sound files.

The sounds are from https://freesound.org/.
